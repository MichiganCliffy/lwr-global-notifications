# LWR Global Notifications & Chatter

Source code to get you started building out Global Notifications (Alarm Bell Icon in global header) for an LWR Site. There is currently no support for notifications for an LWR site, this will get you started building a custom one.

Note: There is an AppExchange package called Notification Bell for Experience Cloud (LWR) built by Salesforce labs that is a great reference point. This code leveraged a lot of the work that was done there. The [source code](https://github.com/salesforce-experiencecloud/notificationbell) is open source.

## Notifications
To receive Chatter mentions in the Experience Cloud site, you need to make sure that the site domain name is added to Remote Site Settings within the Security section of set up.
